      <h1>Hello and welcome, I'm Jan!</h1>
      <p>
        I really like the world of bits & bytes, with all the interesting and 
        smart things which are based on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since my early days, I'm interested in computer science, so I've turned 
        my hobby into a profession. After my apprenticeship as a computer 
        science expert in the subject area of system integration and my first 
        jobs, I've studied business computing and finished it with a master's 
        degree. I'm currently working as a software developer and building 
        primarily Java- and PHP-based web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, I like working with the languages Go, SQL, Markdown and 
        the concepts behind hypertext and everything as code.
      </p>
